# voice-assistant

Basic virtual assistant named Nikolai. Translates voice into text, sends text as
a query to the Wolfram Alpha API and speaks response out loud to the user
using publicly available text to speech technology. Can be easily extended for
any function.

## Running

To run the virtual assistant, simply run `python nikolai.py` in the root
directory of the project. To stop the virtual assistant, simply speak either
`stop` or `end` out loud to the virtual assistant.
